# DL-for-Social-Security
**1. Introduction:**
The study involved downloading and analyzing datasets from Kaggle, including user account and image data. The Instagram dataset provided labels for fake and genuine accounts, while the real vs. fake faces dataset contained images labeled as "real" or "fake."

**#For Identification of Fake profiles**
**2. Importing Libraries for Data Analysis**:
   - _Loading Data Manipulation and Visualization Libraries_:Imports `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization, and `numpy` for numerical operations.

**3. Suppressing Warnings**:
   - _Setting Up Warning Filters_: Defines a function to suppress deprecated warnings, ensuring cleaner outputs during execution.

**4. Loading Training Dataset**:
   - _Reading Training Data_: Loads the training dataset (`instagram_df_train`) by reading a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle.

**5. Loading Test Dataset**:
   - _Reading Test Data_: Loads the test dataset (`instagram_df_test`) from another CSV file, preparing it for later evaluation.

**6. Inspecting Training Data Structure**:
   - _Data Structure Information_: Uses `info()` to display column names, data types, and non-null counts in the training dataset, which helps understand its structure.

**7. Statistical Summary**:
   - _Descriptive Statistics_: Provides a summary with mean, standard deviation, and percentiles of numerical features in the training dataset.

**8. Checking for Missing Values**:
    - _Null Value Check_: Uses `isnull().sum()` to check for missing values in each column of the training dataset, indicating whether any preprocessing steps are needed.

**9. Visualizing Data Distributions**:
    - _Distribution of Fake vs. Real Profiles_: Plots a countplot to show the distribution of fake and real profiles within the dataset, helping visualize class imbalance.

**#For detecting "real" and "fake" profiles**
**10. Data Preprocessing**:
    - _Handling Missing Values_: If any missing values are detected, relevant imputation or data cleaning steps would be applied.
    - _Encoding Categorical Features_: Converts categorical columns into a format suitable for model training, likely using one-hot encoding.

**11. Splitting Data for Training and Validation**:
    - _Train-Validation Split_: Divides the data into training and validation sets to enable model evaluation and tuning.

**12. Feature Scaling**:
    - _Normalization or Standardization_: Scales feature values to ensure that they are on a comparable scale, which can improve model performance and convergence.

**13. Defining Neural Network Model**:
    - _Model Architecture_: Sets up the architecture of the neural network, which includes specifying layers, activation functions, and dropouts, if applicable.

**14. Setting Up Loss Function and Optimizer**:
    - _Loss Function_: Chooses an appropriate loss function, such as binary cross-entropy for binary classification.
    - _Optimizer_: Selects an optimizer like Adam or SGD to adjust model weights during training.

**15. Model Training**:
    - _Training Loop_: Runs the training loop where the model processes training batches, computes loss, and updates weights through backpropagation.
    - _Validation After Each Epoch_: Assesses the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set at each epoch to track learning progress and prevent overfitting.

**16. Evaluating Model Performance**:
    - _Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score_: Calculates various metrics on the test set to evaluate how well the model distinguishes between fake and real profiles.
    -_ Confusion Matrix_: Visualizes the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**17. Visualizing Results**:
    - _Loss and Accuracy Curves_: Plots training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs to assess training dynamics.
    - _ROC Curve_: Plots the ROC curve to visualize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate.

**18. Saving the Model**:
    - _Model Persistence_: Saves the trained model to a file so it can be loaded and used later without retraining.
